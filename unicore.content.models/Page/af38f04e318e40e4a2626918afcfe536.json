  "content": "Answer: YES. Unfortunately, adolescents are having unwanted sexual experiences at increasing rates. Any unwanted sex is always wrong. Experiencing forced sex is a terrible ordeal for anyone that comes with potentially long term effects that are hard to predict (both physical and mental). If you know someone who has been forced into unwanted sex, they need your support now more than ever. Listening is a good start. Encourage them to speak to a doctor or nurse so that they can have any necessary medical help. Telling an adult you trust is another positive step to take.",
